The objective of this project is to perform linear regression analysis (ordinary least square technique) using Python Statsmodels to predict the car price, based on the automobile dataset from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile), which is a common dataset for regression analysis. The automobile dataset is from the year 1985 which is quite old, but it's suitable for the learning purposes of this project.
